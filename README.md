## Exploration of the relationship between gut microbiome and ethnicity

Certain serum metabolites, which are produced by the microorganisms in the gut, are associated with a greater risk for developing Alzheimer's disease.  According to [Race, Ethnicity, and Alzheimer’s](https://aaic.alz.org/downloads2020/2020_Race_and_Ethnicity_Fact_Sheet.pdf), "African Americans are about two times more likely", and "Hispanics are about one and one-half times more likely than white Americans to have Alzheimer’s and other dementias". Will any of these ethnic groups exhibit higher levels of the risk-associated metabolites?

In case of a high correlation, we are interested in the factors which explain the relationship. The factors could be enviromental (dietary habits and lifestyle), or genetic. Since the genetic data are already part of the ADNI collection, I will focus on finding out, if collecting dietary habits adds value to the research. The underlying assumption is, that depending on what food we consume, different microbial strains will thrive. And since dietary habits are influenced by one's culture and ethnicity, this risk factor should be addressed on socio-cultural level.
